# UI Recreation Project

## Overview

This project is a recreation of a design that showcases a minimal and modern product page for a "Shell chair." The main goal was to replicate the UI design as closely as possible before I learned how to code, demonstrating my design and development skills.


## Design Inspiration

The design features a clean, modern aesthetic with a strong use of vibrant colors, particularly the orange background that highlights the product. The page layout emphasizes the product image, with a clear and easy-to-read product description and pricing information.


## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The UI was designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Product Highlight**: The chair is prominently displayed in the center, with supporting details like the product name, description, and price easily accessible.

- **Add to Bag Button**: A functional "Add to Bag" button was implemented, though it's a front-end simulation.
- **Color Selection**: A color swatch feature allows users to view different color options for the product.


## Challenges Faced

- **Wave Background Effect**: One of the significant challenges was replicating the wave effect in the background. Due to my limited coding experience at the time, I couldn't achieve the desired wave effect. Instead, I opted for a linear background as a placeholder. This alternative maintained the clean look of the design but lacked the dynamic visual impact of the original wave.

- **Precise Alignment and Spacing**: Ensuring that all elements were aligned correctly and spaced evenly proved to be challenging. I had to manually adjust margins and paddings, which required a lot of trial and error.

- **Typography**: Matching the exact fonts and sizes from the design was tricky. I had to find the closest matches, but some differences remain compared to the original design.

- **Color Matching**: Replicating the exact color shades used in the design was another challenge. I used approximate colors to maintain the overall look and feel.

- **Image Placement**: Centering the product image and ensuring it looked good across different screen sizes required careful attention to detail.


## Technologies Used

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript 

- Basic Design Tools (for color matching and layout planning)


## Installation

To view the project locally:

- Clone this repository.

- Open index.html in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Implement the wave effect in the background using SVG or CSS techniques once I gain more experience.

- Fine-tune the typography and spacing to match the original design more closely.

- Add more interactive elements like hover effects and animations.



This project was an excellent learning experience, allowing me to apply my design knowledge and improve my coding skills. While I encountered several challenges, the process helped me understand the importance of precision and attention to detail in UI design.
